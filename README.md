# SOLID Principles Implementation in Java

This repository contains Java code examples demonstrating the **SOLID principles** — the five key object-oriented design principles that help software become more maintainable, scalable, and testable.

## What This Repo Includes

For each principle, you will find:
- **Before applying the principle** — Code that violates the principle.
- **After applying the principle** — Refactored code that follows the principle.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   A class should have only one reason to change.

2. **O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

4. **I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. **D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
